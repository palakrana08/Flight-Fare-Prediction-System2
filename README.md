Flight-Fare-Prediction-System2
People love to travel with their friends and families whenever they get tired and bored from their daily lifestyle.Whenever it comes to the medium of travel,everyone likes to choose a medium which is affordable and takes less amount of time.Airways are the best medium when you want to reach your destination in the minimum time.But the problem where people get confused is the “PRICE”.People who regularly travel through flights know about the trends in prices.But there are also many people who are inexperienced in booking tickets and end up falling in discount traps made by the companies.
“Flight Fare Prediction System” is a Machine Learning based project where in we would build a predictive model using various Machine Learning algorithms likeDecisin tree regressor,KNN,SVM,Random Forest Classifier ,XGB to the collected historical data of flights.The concept is to find the most efficient algorithm from above mentioned ML algorithms that would come up with better accuracy than othersThis algorithm will then be used to build an application that would give user a fare idea about flight prices and he would get a predicted value for price based on some given inputs which would save money and time.
